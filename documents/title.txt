Episode MMXVI

THE HUNT ON DAGOBAH

Since the fall of the Republic, the Sith have been hunting the Jedi.

Now that the contents of the Jedi Archives have been sliced open, the hideout locations of the last remaining Jedi have been uplinked to the Imperial Data Network at opencaching.us

Lord Vader commissioned an enhancement to his mask to track the hidden Jedi to their location by coupling a Galaxy Position System (GPS) to a Particle Photon. The enhancement must point to the direction of the nearest Jedi cache and reveal its distance.

Lord Vader is trying the device for the first time by hunting an old master on Dagobah.
